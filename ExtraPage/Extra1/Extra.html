      The islands in HaLong Bay are mainly limestone and schist islands most lying in the two main areas: the
      southeastern part of
      Bai Tu Long Bay and southwestern part of HaLong Bay. These islands represent the most ancient images of a
      geographical site
      having a tectonic age of from 250 million to 280 million years. They are the result of many times of rising and
      lowering
      processes of the continent to form a karst. The process of nearly full erosion and weathering of the karst
      created the unique
      Ha Long Bay in the world. In a not very large area, thousands of islands with different forms look like
      glittering emeralds
      attached to the blue scarf of a virgin. The area where many stone islands concentrate has spectacular scenes and
      world-famous
      caves and is the center of Ha Long Bay Natural Heritage, including HaLong Bay and a part of BÃ¡i Tu Long Bay.
