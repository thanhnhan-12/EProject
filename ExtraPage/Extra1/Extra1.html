      <h1 class="extra-address">Ha Long Bay</h1>
      <p class="extra-description">
        The islands in HaLong Bay are mainly limestone and schist islands most lying in the two main areas: the
        southeastern part of
        Bái Tử Long Bay and southwestern part of HaLong Bay. These islands represent the most ancient images of a
        geographical site
        having a tectonic age of from 250 million to 280 million years. They are the result of many times of rising and
        lowering
        processes of the continent to form a karst. The process of nearly full erosion and weathering of the karst
        created the unique
        Ha Long Bay in the world. In a not very large area, thousands of islands with different forms look like
        glittering emeralds
        attached to the blue scarf of a virgin. The area where many stone islands concentrate has spectacular scenes and
        world-famous
        caves and is the center of Ha Long Bay Natural Heritage, including HaLong Bay and a part of Bái Tu Long Bay.
