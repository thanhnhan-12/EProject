    <p>My Khe beach is a 32-mile stretch of white sand beach that is approximately 6 km east of Da Nang. The beach was
      made famous by movies and TV shows as a place where American soldiers of the Vietnam War enjoyed peace in Da Nang.
      My Khe beach was also named one of the 6 most beautiful beaches in the world by Forbes Magazine. Hosting a number
      of high-class resorts and hotels, the beach is an idyllic spot for sunbathing, fishing, and a variety of water
      activities to enjoy during your stay.<br>
      Another wonderful beach that you should check out is Bac My An Beach, which is home to a collection of Da Nang's
      5-star beach resorts and hotels. With a length of 4 km, the beach can accommodate more than 5,000 beachgoers at a
      time. The resorts offer private spaces for guests to sunbathe and enjoy outdoor activities. But if you do not
      intend to stay in a luxury resort, you can find public beach sites. There are several mid-range hotels surrounding
      the beach, as well as plenty of local restaurants serving seafood.<br>
      Son Tra peninsula is where you could discover some of Danang's most hidden beaches like Tien Sa, Bai Bac and Con
      beach. Located about 8 km from the city center, it is home to the rare red-shanked doucs.<br>
      Lang Co Beach is located between Truong Son Mountain and the Southern end of Hai Van Pass, spaning 10 km in
      length. It is one of the most hidden beaches in Danang as it is mostly visited by locals and Hai Van Pass's
      travellers.
