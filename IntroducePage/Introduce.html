      <h1>HOW TO GET TO BROOME FROM DARWIN</h1>
      <p>
        Broome is also known as <strong>Rubibi</strong> and is the <strong>biggest town</strong> in the <strong>Kimberly
          region</strong> of
        <strong>Western Australia</strong>. Broome lies around 1700 km from Perth, it is a quiet small town with around
        14,000 people living there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>best way how to get to Broome from Darwin</strong> is to <strong>drive</strong> in your car or
        camper through the
        Kimberly region, which we also highly recommend you to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you can also cut the long journey by <strong>flying</strong> in, as there is also a
        <a href="">Broome International airport</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are driving from Darwin to Broome, there are also other spots where you can stop such as <strong>Lake
          Argyle</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <div id="section2" class="section2" >
      <h1>BEST THINGS TO SEE IN BROOME</h1>
      <p>
        Before coming to Western Australia, we had no idea that Broome even existed and once you visit, you will be
        surprised by
        the diversity of landscape that Broome has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are talking <strong>red and white sand beaches</strong>, extraordinary <strong>fauna</strong> and
        <strong>flora</strong>,
        and unique <strong>wild animals</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are absolutely the <strong>best things to do in Broome and around.</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="section2-img">
        <img src="./Images/Broome.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2.1 -->
      <h1 id="section21">ROEBUCK BAY LOOKOUT</h1>
      <p>
        One of the highlights in Broome is definitely the beaches. In particular <strong>Roebuck Bay beaches</strong>.
        This incredible contrast of
        colors will strike your eyes.
      </p>
      <div class="section2-img">
        <img src="./Images/Broome-2.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        Roebuck Bay is an <strong>extraordinary place</strong>, where you can see <strong>red sand beaches, turquoise
          water,</strong> and
        <strong>green mangroves</strong> at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can come to <strong>Roebuck Bay lookout</strong> first. It's very easy to get to as there is a parking lot
        nearby.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 2.2 -->
      <h1 id="section22">ROEBUCK BAY REMOTE BEACHES</h1>
      <p>
        However we recommend you to drive further to enjoy the beautiful scenery without many people. In order to get to
        the more
        <strong>remote beaches of Roebuck</strong> be prepared to drive around <strong>30 km</strong> on a gravel road
        from the city
        center. We spent there the whole afternoon and admiring its beauty.
      </p>
      <div class="section2-img">
        <img src="./Images/Broome-3.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        Make sure to <strong>come here around noon</strong> or midday. when the tight is low, so you can see
        <strong>mangrove trees</strong>
        in the water.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 2.3 -->
      <h1 id="section23">BIRD OBSERVATORY</h1>
      <p>
        Broome area is a <strong>bird watcher paradise. 325 bird species</strong> have been seen in Broome. You can also
        see many
        migratory shorebirds here as well. You can join one of the tours where you can learn more.
      </p>
      <p class="has-background">
        <strong>EXTRA TIP FROM US:</strong> Make sure to download a free app on your phone to help you to identify the
        type of birds.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 2.4 -->
      <h1 id="section24">CAMEL RIDE AT CABLE BEACH</h1>
      <p>One of the best things to see in Broome is definitely <strong>cable beach</strong> with camels.</p>
      <p>
        If you have seen some pictures on Insta from Broome, it must have been the one where you can see
        <strong>camels on the beach.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not big fans of riding any animals, but we have to say that camels looked happy and they were treated
        very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cable beach is very famous for a <strong>camel ride at the sunset</strong> and if there is no way you can miss
        it.
      </p>
      <p>There are few companies who do these tours and you can check the most popular one <a href="">here</a>. </p>

      <!-- Section 2.5 -->
      <h1 id="section25">ENJOY SUNSET AT THE CABLE BEACH</h1>
      <p>
        You can also just come to the beach, bring a drink or two and <strong>enjoy stunning sunset</strong> and
        mesmerizing colors.
        If you have 4WD, and if you are keen to drive on the beach, you definitely can.
      </p>
      <div class="section2-img">
        <img src="./Images/Broome-4.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        If you like to stay out of the beach and just enjoy a sunset from a different perspective, there are a couple of
        bars and
        restaurants where you can have a drink or dinner and enjoy a beautiful sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we also recommend you to come here during the day, to enjoy some good time on a <strong>white sand
          beach.</strong>
        The water is incredibly turquoise, just make sure to check for safety signs for swimming.
      </p>
      <p>You can <strong>hire a chair and umbrella, kayaks, or paddleboards.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div id="section3" class="section3">
      <h1>STAIRCASE TO THE MOON</h1>
      <p>From March till October, you can witness a <strong>natural phenomenon</strong> known as the
        <strong>Staircase to the moon.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The most famous spots in Broome to see <strong>Staircase to the moon</strong> are along the Royeback bay all the
        way to
        the town beach, also in front of <strong>Mangrove hotel</strong> or night market in <strong>Town beach.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Broome is not the only place where you can <strong>“climb the stairs”.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see it also along the <strong>Pilbara</strong> and <strong>Kimberley Coastline.</strong>
      </p>

      <h1>WHY IT IS CALLED STAIRACE TO THE MOON?</h1>
      <p>
        Since Broome has the highest tides, the full moon rising above the ocean might seem very close to the water.
        That creates the <strong>illusion of seeing a staircase leading to the moon.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        West Australia is very popular for its star gazing due to very little light pollution. In Broome,
        you can go for an <strong>Astro tour with Greg</strong> known as <strong>spaceGandalf.</strong> Broome is
        located to see
        the best of both the Southern and northern hemisphere sky with two galaxies clearly visible and also brightens
        parts of
        Milky Way galaxy displayed overhead.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 3.1 -->
      <h1 id="section31">BROOME COURTHOUSE MARKETS</h1>
      <p>
        Every Saturday, Sunday from 8-13, and Thursday nights at <strong>Town beach</strong> you can stroll through a
        cute market,
        where you can buy <strong>locally made pearls</strong>, clothes, try delicious local coffee and food.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 3.2 -->
      <h1 id="section32">SUNSET AT GATHEAUME POINT</h1>
      <p>
        Just 10 mins away from Broome city center, you can walk around the red cliff coastline. It is definitely worth
        coming here for the sunset and to enjoy the views.
      </p>
      <div class="section3-img">
        <img src="./Images/Broome-5.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <!-- Section 3.3 -->
      <h1 id="section33">SEARCH FOR DINO FOOTPRINT</h1>
      <p>You can search for <strong>dinosaur footprints</strong> around this area. Seemingly it is 112 million years old
        and fossiled in the rock.</p>
      <p>
        However, it is quite difficult to find them. You need to wait for a low tide to see them. Many people come here
        after sunset with torches to look for them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div id="section4" class="section4">
      <h1>BEST THINGS TO SEE AROUND BROOME</h1>
      <p>
        There are more things you can see around Broome. you have more budget you can take a scenic flight to
        <strong>Horizontal falls.</strong>
      </p>

      <!-- Section 4.1 -->
      <h1 id="section41">WILLI CREAK </h1>
      <p>
        No, this is not Whitsundays in Queensland. Although you might be confused when you see a picture from
        <strong>Willi Creak.</strong>
        This is a place very close to Broome and definitely, a must place for your visit.
      </p>
      <div class="section4-img">

      </div>
      <p>
        The color of the water is absolutely amazing. We have never seen such a color of the water, so <strong>milky
          blue.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't really walk around much around this area, but there is a spot where you can camp.
        Be careful and <strong>watch out for crocodiles</strong> that were spotted in this area!
      </p>
      <p class="has-background" style="background-color:#fffaeb">TIP FROM US: Make sure you only <strong>drive with
          4WD</strong> as the road is unpaved and corrugated. Don't forget to deflate your tires!&nbsp;

        And this is how we imagined how Australia would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        And one of our highlights on our Australia trip was to see the red cliffs of <strong>James Price Point.</strong>
        If you would like to experience the wild-wild west on your own, without paying a cent, then this is for you.

      <h1>BEST TIME TO VISIT BROOME </h1>
      <p>The best time to visit Broome is definitely <strong>winter times,</strong> which is from March till October.
      </p>
      <p>
        Days are sunny with an average temperature of 30, nights are a bit cool so bring a jumper. Also, this is a
        perfect time to see
        <strong>“Stairways to the moon.”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can visit in summer if you are ready to battle over 40 degrees temperature. I like heat but this is not fun.
